\section{equation 1}
As can be seen in this figure, decreased stepsize leads to increased accuracy. This was to be expected, however further notice should be layed on the differences between the two explicit solutions. The Midpoint solution shows better accuracy at higher Stepsizes. This phenomenon can be observed on almost all percieved equations.
