\lstinputlisting[language=Matlab, firstline=16, lastline=34, caption=Testing method for the different solver, label=PrintingFunction]{test_ode1.m}
As seen in listing \ref{PrintingFunction} is every Function tested with the three different solving methods tested. In addition to that, the ideal function is printed with a greatly increased accuracy. This ensures that the best-possible comparison can be pulled from this plots.
